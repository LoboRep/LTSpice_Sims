Model "u2:pmos": Oxide thickness thinner than recommended for a level 3 MOSFET.
Model "u2:nmos": Oxide thickness thinner than recommended for a level 3 MOSFET.
WARNING: Specified period is not longer than the sum of Trise, Tfall, and Ton for v2.  Increasing period to 1.01
WARNING: Less than two connections to node INPUTPWM.  This node is used by V3.
